                <h3>Beginnings</h3>
                <p>Sir John Monash was born on 27 June 1865 in Melbourne. From an early age, his intelligence was noted by teachers. Monash was dux in mathematics and modern languages and equal dux of his school, Scotch College at the age of 16. </p>

            <div class="entry">
                <h3>University Life</h3>
                <p>He enrolled in arts and engineering at the University of Melbourne, though his studies stopped after 2 years due to financial insecurities. To pay for the bills, he worked on the Princess Bridge in 1884. This was the start of his engineering career.</p>
                <p>That same year, Monash joined the University Company, D Company, 4th Battalion, Victorian Rifles. He became a notable soldier in the ranks as well as Australia’s expert in bridges, railways and other construction projects, as a result of his knowledge of engineering, staff work, and natural intelligence</p>

        <h2> Role in World War I </h2>

        <div>
            <div id="event1" class="entry">
                <h3>Landing at Anzac Cove</h3>
                <p id="highlight1">At the start of World War I, Monash was one of the first people to go to Gallipoli in command of the 4th Infantry Brigade, setting foot on Gallipoli on 26 April 1915. During his time in Gallipoli, Monash commanded 200,000 troops including soldiers from Australia, New Zealand and Britain. The Gallipoli campaign was the first battle that Australia participated in as a nation. However, it became a failed 8-month mission with all Australian brigade commanders dead or evacuated wounded except Monash.  </p>
            </div>
           <div id="event2" class="entry">
                <h3>The Evacuation of Gallipoli</h3>
                <p>Evacuating soldiers was no easy task. Keeping the Turks under the impression the allies were still fighting, was key to the evacuation. Monash was given the task of operating the withdrawal of troops from Gallipoli, describing the days leading up to the evacuation in a letter home as being ‘uneventful’, and full of planning. Those plans described how he divided the brigade into 3 echelons or groups, with the last being the ‘die hards’. Those last 170 soldiers had to be ‘the most gallant and capable men in the brigade’. They fired their rifles for the last time up until 3am, when the ‘die hards’ came down to the waiting boats. </p>
                <p>Nonetheless, Monash managed to evacuate 45,000 soldiers without a single casualty from Anzac Cove.</p>
                <p id="highlight2">The evacuation was completed successfully on 20 December 1915.  Arriving at the safety of Egypt, soldiers and Monash alike were elated, giving hearty interactions with one another. </p>
                <p>Without Monash’s leadership and service to the rehabilitation of his troops, there may not have been an Anzac Day.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="event3" class="entry">
                <h3>The First Anzac Day</h3>
                <p id="highlight3" onclick="highlightText('highlight3')">The first celebration was organised by an eager Monash, saying in a letter “...I turned out the whole brigade with all attached units at 6:45 AM”.</p>
                <p>Though he also noted of the very somber moments on that day “Every man who had served in Gallipoli wore a blue ribbon on the right breast, and every man, who, in addition, had taken part in the historic landing ... wore a red ribbon also ... Alas but few of us are left, who were entitled to both”. This speaks on the number of Anzacs who lost their lives in Gallipoli. <br> However, the day was also filled with ‘unplanned amusements’ and cricket matches. Monash was a leader who truly cared for his soldiers, seeing that morale was essential to creating a brigade that worked in unity. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="event4" class="entry">
                <h3>Sent to the Western Front</h3>
                <p id="highlight4" onclick="highlightText('highlight4')">In June 1916, Monash was sent to the Western Front in France with the 3rd Division, in a need to support Allied powers who were devastatingly in a stalemate with the Germans. </p>
                <p>Soldiers there were weak and tired. This didn’t come without backlash. Criticisms on his time in Gallipoli made some individuals sceptical, not to mention being promoted to Major-General in July.</p>

                    <h3>Promoted to Lieutant-General</h3>
                    <p id="highlight5" onclick="highlightText('highlight5')">In June 1918, he was appointed as lieutenant-general and then commander of the Battle of Hamel as well as The Battle of Amiens because of his success on the front.</p>
                    <p>Monash’s leadership combined arms tactics and coordination between infantry, artillery, tanks and air support. His extensive briefings and trainings given to troops made them highly competent. </p>

                        <p id="highlight6" onclick="highlightText('highlight6')">On 4 July 1918, the Battle of Hamel commenced with the goal of capturing the town of Le Hamel. </p>
                        <p>The battle map made by Monash shows the staged capture of the town - by securing the area, creating a flank for future offensives made by the Allies. <br> This was done by synchronously aligning the bombing of air offensives to the movement of tanks, disguising the on-ground attack and leaving Germans surprised. This creative idea engineered by Monash tied with his planning, created a seamless attack. </p>

                    <p>The 5th division of the AIF went into battle under the command of John Monash. Monash continued his organised tactics, and the battle was successful. It marked the start of The Hundred Days as well as the turning tide of the stalemate battle at the Western Front.</p>
                    <p>Monash’s efforts weren’t left without recognition. 4 days later, Monash was knighted by King George V. </p>

                <p>With his arrival, he campaigned to have all Australian troops enshrined in Australian history, fathering The National War Memorial of Victoria, hence the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne. However, this wouldn’t be seen until 1934. </p>

                <p>n 1920, he became the manager of Victoria's State Electricity Commission (SEC) and continued his profession of a civil engineer. His time as manager helped to grow Victoria’s brown coal reserves as well as extending the power grid, both fundamental in the development of technology and electricity. </p>
                <p>Sir John Monash died on October 8 due to a heart disease. A state funeral was held in his honour with 300,000 people attending</p>
               <p>Monash’s commitment to lifelong learning as well as being a person of action for his community are traits that are admired. 
                Shown in his battles in WW1 but also in his role as a developer of Melbourne, his admirable sense of character was established into Monash University, founded in his name in 1958.  </p>
